				Luxore Terms of Use
			</h2>

			<div id="section1" class="section scrollspy">
				<div class="faq-title"><h3 translate>1.  WHO, WHY, WHAT</h3></div>
				<p translate>
					<b>Who:</b> Luxore project is maintained by Luxore Foundation ("LF"). At times LF may also be referred to as "we", "us", or "Luxore.me". The person who is viewing or interacting with this project we will refer to as "you", "hey you", or where appropriate "jerkface" (only if you're being bad - or childish). "Our" will be used to both parties, 'cause the network is decentralized and distributed.<br><br><b>Why:</b> This Terms of Service Agreement ("Agreement") is our contract (not a <a class="linx" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract" target="_blank">smart one,</a> though!) with you, and tells you what you can and can't do and what we can and can't do with you.<br><br><b>What:</b> Luxore is a bad ass capitalist-inspired project aimed at making people feel good about themselves (really oppressive, huh?) and to connect people with the same interests in different areas of fashion anywhere in the world. Luxore is build with <a class="linx" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_%28database%29" target="_blank">blockchain</a> technology and have it's own "money", coin, or digital currency: <a class="linx" href="http://www.luxore.me/blog/">LUX</a>.<br><br>Luxore has a few rules: (1) all transactions are made only with LUX. (2) Companies will advertise their intentions of advertise! (3) You can choose whether or not to accept ads.<br>We can change these Terms at any time. You should check this page regularly, to make sure that it is still funny!
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="section2" class="section scrollspy">
				<div class="faq-title"><h3 translate>2.  WHAT IS YOURS, IS YOURS TO KEEP</h3></div>
				<p translate>
					Your photos, your property, your rules. Luxore gives you a way to make money by posting photos. In every photo, you'll have up to 4 (four) ad spaces to fill the way you want... You can always leave your photos without ads, although we DO NOT recommend that (see <a class="linx" href="http://www.luxore.me/blog/">here</a>).<br>Important: WE DO NOT OWN THE NETWORK OR THE APP. Personal information is end-to-end encrypted, the storage is distributed and the connections decentralized.
				</p>

			<div id="section3" class="section scrollspy">
				<div class="faq-title"><h3 translate>3.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h3></div>
				<p translate>
					Well... that...<br>...is a nonsense.<br>Learn more <a class="linx" href="https://mises.org/library/against-intellectual-property-0" target="_blank">here</a> and <a class="linx" href="http://everythingisaremix.info/" target="_blank">here</a>.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="section4" class="section scrollspy">
				<div class="faq-title"><h3 translate>4.  VERY BAD THINGS THAT YOU CANNOT DO</h3></div>
				<p translate>
					People have freedom of association (or not to associate) and we respect that! All we ask is: Don't be a jerkface. A jerkface is someone who discriminates, defrauds, hates, or acts like an idiot. Don't do any of that. Although we cannot forbid you, other people may not like when you act like that and we gave 'em the weapons to fight when you behave like a jerkface (<a class="linx">blog post soon!</a>).
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="section5" class="section scrollspy">
				<div class="faq-title"><h3 translate>5.  RESPONSIBILITIES</h3></div>
				<p translate>
					You can post content - it's a social network.. You agree to remain responsible for anything that you post. Your property! That's a lot of power, but remember: "with great powers comes great responsibilities". You can do business in your terms, in your space, as long as it is voluntary.<br>LF's only job is software maintenance for which we claim 10% of the total income with the ads for making this wonderful system for you. (Low cost rent).
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="section6" class="section scrollspy">
				<div class="faq-title"><h3 translate>6.  U MAD? GONNA LAWYER UP BRO?</h3></div>
				<p translate>
					We have lawyers. A whole team of them that are ready to knife fight on a whim... NOT!! But if you have problem with someone first go talk to that person. If you still have a problem, remove that person physically, so to speak (block). We don't have anything to do with the content posted or your fights. If you have a problem with us, make sure it is our problem. We may talk about this for awhile, and if neither side is happy with the result then we can duke it out in Court. The Court must be private, and will be decided based on contracts rules. Oh, and the winner of any dispute or lawsuit is entitled to have their attorneys' fees and costs paid for by the loser.	    
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="section7" class="section scrollspy">
				<div class="faq-title"><h3 translate>7.  SURVIVAL OF THE DEAD… AGREEMENT</h3></div>
				<p translate>
					Sometimes, people mutually agree to stuff that courts just won't uphold. That is their problem and that shouldn't affect the intent of our contract, though, so you agree that if a judge declares a portion of these Terms of Service of no effect, it really doesn't matter... terms here are very generic. The Terms of Service will stay in effect - our property our rules, right?! That is because WE DON'T OWN the network. The goal of the project is to be decentralized, and the goal of LF is to give maintenance and improvements. So there are no one to be held responsible for it.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="section8" class="section scrollspy">
				<div class="faq-title"><h3 translate>8.  THIRD PARTY SHARING</h3></div>
				<p translate>
					Our site/app may have links to third party websites that we have no control over, such as YouTube, Facebook, and MySpace (seriously.. who uses myspace anymore?). We have no responsibility over this content (although if those companies want to give us free shares in their company we're cool with that) and therefore you have to take up any problems you have with those sites with their owners. Leave us out of it.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="section9" class="section scrollspy">
				<div class="faq-title"><h3 translate>9.  LOUD NOISES</h3></div>
				<p translate>
					WE HAVE TO USE CAPS LOCK FOR THIS SECTION BECAUSE SOME DEAD GUY 100 YEARS AGO PROBABLY SAID IF WE DON'T THEN IT DOESN'T COUNT. SO WE CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT OUR SITE/APP WON'T BREAK YOUR COMPUTER/PHONE OR THAT YOU'LL FIND IT AMUSING OR THAT IT WILL HELP YOU MAKE MONEY. WE TRY OUR BEST, BUT THAT'S ALL YOU GET JUST LIKE WHEN YOU BUY SOMETHING AT A RANDOM GARAGE SALE… YOU'RE BUYING IT "AS IS" EVEN IF IT BLOWS UP OR FRIES YOUR BRAIN. SO EVEN IF SOMETHING TERRIBLE AND CATASTROPHIC HAPPENS BECAUSE YOU VIEWED OUR SITE/APP, YOU CAN'T SUE US, OR ANYONE THAT IS CONNECTED WITH US. SINCE WE'RE EVERYWHERE (DISTRIBUTED AND DECENTRALIZED, REMEMBER?), SO WE WANT TO COPY THAT FANCY LAW SOMEWHERE THAT SAYS IF YOU GIVE UP YOUR "GENERAL" RIGHTS TO CLAIMS YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHTS TO CLAIMS THAT YOU COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN ABOUT (MAKES SENSE RIGHT?) WE'LL GUESS WHAT YOU ARE GIVING THOSE RIGHTS UP BECAUSE THIS IS A CONTRACT AND WE JUST TOLD YOU. SORRY! SO WE'RE DISCLAIMING ALL WARRANTIES AND LIABILITY FOR ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING, WHETHER OR NOT WE KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN PSYCHIC AND KNEW.

			<div id="section10" class="section scrollspy">
				<div class="faq-title"><h3 translate>10. MISC THINGS</h3></div>
				<p translate>
				    IF YOU'RE FROM A FOREIGN COUNTRY, WELCOME.. GUTENTAG, NEI HO, BONJOUR, JAMBO, HOLA… (that doesn't make any sense.. foreign from where?). Well, we don't have your information, so we're not going to be transferring your information to any country... Unless you're from Brazil, then… well… let us know and we'll figure out what to do with you... Ha ha, just kidding! Headings to these sections are meant to be for entertainment purposes only and have no binding effect. We can transfer our rights and obligations in this agreement whenever we want. Just because we don't put someone in a burlap sack and beat them with a sock full of quarters for violating any section of this Agreement doesn't mean we're waiving our right to enforce our Agreement (?), it just means we're cutting someone some slack. It doesn't mean we'll do the same for you or anyone else. Follow the "law" and don't be a jerkface.
